title: Voltage
description: A comprehensive guide to voltage, its role as the driving force of electric current, and its applications in robotics and circuit design.

Voltage, also known as electrical potential difference, is the difference in electric potential between two points in an electrical circuit. It is the force that drives the flow of electric current.

**Analogy:**

Voltage is like the difference in potential between the finish line and the starting line of a sporting event. The higher the voltage, the harder it is for the current to flow.

**Data:**

> - **Name:** Voltage
> - **Symbol:** (V)
> - **Unit of measurement:** Volt (V)
