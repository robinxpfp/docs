Electric power is the amount of electrical energy transferred or consumed per unit of time, and it's measured in watts (W). It's the measure of how quickly electrical work is done.

The formula to calculate electric power in a circuit is:

P=VI

**Where:**

> -P represents power in watts (W).  
> -V is voltage in volts (V).  
> -I is current in amperes (A).

This formula expresses that electric power is equal to the product of voltage and current in a circuit.

**Analogy:**

Imagine a light bulb in your home. Electrical power is how quickly the light bulb shines. If it's high power, it shines brightly and fills the room with light quickly. If it's low power, the light is softer and takes more time to illuminate. Electrical power is like the force with which the light bulb does its job and controls how quickly it does electrical work or dissipates energy.
