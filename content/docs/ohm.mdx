Ohm's law states that the electric current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage difference between its ends and inversely proportional to its resistance.

> - (I) is the electric current, measured in amperes (A)
> - (V) is the voltage difference, measured in volts (V)
> - (R) is the resistance, measured in ohms (Î©)

**Equivalencies:**

> - **(I)** : V/R - Ampere
> - **(V)** : I \* R - Resistance
> - **(R)** : V/I - Voltage
