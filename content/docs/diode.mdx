**Diode (D1)**

A diode is a semiconductor device that allows current to flow in only one direction. 
It has a positive pole (Anode) and a negative pole (Cathode). The flow of current is 
permitted from positive to negative.

**Analogy:**
If we have a circuit and connect the power supply with the poles reversed, devices 
like capacitors could explode or get damaged. However, if we use a diode when making 
incorrect power supply connections, it won't allow the current to flow, thus protecting 
electronic devices. It will only allow current flow if the polarity is correctly 
configured.
