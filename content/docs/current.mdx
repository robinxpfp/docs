**Electric Current (I)**

Electric current is the flow of electrons through a conductor. It can be defined as the amount of electric charge that passes through a given point in a given time.

**Analogy:**

Electrons move like participants in a sporting event, attracted by the negative charge. Electric current is the amount of participants that pass through a given point in a given time.

**Data:**

> - **Name:** Current
> - **Symbol:** (I)
> - **Unit of measurement:** Ampere (A)

**Direct Current (DC)**

Direct current is a constant flow of electrons in one direction. It has polarity, i.e., positive and negative.

> - **Name:** Direct current or direct current
> - **Symbol:** DC
> - **Unit of measurement:** Ampere (A)

**Alternating Current (AC)**

Alternating current is a flow of electrons that changes direction and polarity over time. AC flows from one direction to the other, creating an oscillating pattern. It is the most widely used because it is more efficient for transmitting electricity over long distances. It does not have a fixed polarity, but it is divided into phase, neutral, and ground.
